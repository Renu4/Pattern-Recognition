# Pattern-Recognition
In this task, our goal is to use few suitable recognition strategy to recognize the pattern and classify them. We
have choose "Iris" dataset which is most famous for pattern recognition fromUCI machine learning datasets.
The dataset consists of 150 samples of Iris plant species with 4 dierent features called sepal-length, sepalwidth,
petal-length, petal-width. It labelled three classes of plants Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica.
For classication, we have used four methods KNN, SVM, decision tree and MLP, among them KNN and SVM
gives better accuracy as 98%.
